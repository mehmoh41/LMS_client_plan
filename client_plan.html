    <h1>School LMS: Project Implementation Plan</h1>

    <div class="project-overview">
        <h3>Project Governance & Overview</h3>
        <p>This document outlines the 9-phase implementation plan for your new School Learning Management System. Our process is built on transparency, quality, and incremental delivery. Each 10-day "sprint" concludes with a set of concrete deliverables
            for your review, ensuring the project aligns perfectly with your goals.</p>
        <p>Our guiding principle is to build a platform that is:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure & Reliable:</strong> Protecting your school's data is our top priority.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> The system will be intuitive for admins, teachers, and students.</li>
                <li><strong>Fully Responsive:</strong> A seamless experience on any device—phone, tablet, or desktop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Total Budget:</strong> $1500 USD<br>
                <strong>Total Timeline:</strong> 90 Days</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <div class="phase-header">
            <h3>Phase 1: Core Foundation & Admin Control (Days 1-10)</h3>
            <div class="phase-payment">$200</div>
        </div>
        <h4>What You Get (Key Deliverables):</h4>
        <ul class="deliverables">
            <li><strong>The Master Control Panel:</strong> A secure login for you (the administrator) where you can manage the entire platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Full User Management:</strong> You will receive a central dashboard to add new accounts, edit existing ones, and manage profiles for all your teachers, staff, and students.</li>
            <li><strong>Role & Permission System:</strong> We will build the "permission engine" that controls *who* sees *what*. This ensures teachers can't access admin settings and students can only see their own courses.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="why-matters">
            <strong>Why This Matters (Benefit to Your School):</strong> This phase is the secure foundation of your entire digital school. It gives you centralized control and peace of mind, knowing your school's data is properly organized and protected
            from day one.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="phase">
        <div class="phase-header">
            <h3>Phase 2: Teacher's Course Management Hub (Days 11-20)</h3>
            <div class="phase-payment">$200</div>
        </div>
        <h4>What You Get (Key Deliverables):</h4>
        <ul class="deliverables">
            <li><strong>Teacher's "Home Base":</strong> A personal, private dashboard for each teacher when they log in.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Classroom Creation:</strong> Teachers get simple, user-friendly tools to create their "digital classrooms" (e.g., "Grade 10 Math," "Grade 8 History") with a name and description.</li>
            <li><strong>Class Roster View:</strong> Teachers will be able to see a clear, simple list of all students officially enrolled in each of their classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="why-matters">
            <strong>Why This Matters (Benefit to Your School):</strong> This phase empowers your teachers. It gives them the digital space they need to build their courses and manage their students effectively, without needing technical skills. It's the
            online equivalent of handing them the keys to their new classroom.

        <h4>What You Get (Key Deliverables):</h4>
        <ul class="deliverables">

            <li><strong>Organized Lessons:</strong> We will build a feature to structure content into logical units (e.g., "Unit 1: Algebra," "Week 2: The Middle Ages"), making it easy for students to follow.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Student Enrollment (SIS Sync):</strong> This is a major time-saver. We build a tool for you to sync the LMS with your main school database (SIS). This *automatically creates* student accounts and enrolls them in the correct
                online classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="why-matters">
            <strong>Why This Matters (Benefit to Your School):</strong> This phase brings the classrooms to life with content and saves your administrative staff hundreds of hours of manual data entry. It makes student onboarding seamless and error-free.

            <li><strong>Automated Visibility:</strong> The moment a teacher publishes an assignment, it appears on the course page for all enrolled students.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="why-matters">
            <strong>Why This Matters (Benefit to Your School):</strong> This moves the core homework process online. It establishes a clear, consistent, and trackable way for teachers to assign work and for students to see exactly what's due and when.

            <li><strong>The Digital Gradebook:</strong> This is the teacher's most powerful tool. It's a single, organized page (like a spreadsheet) showing all students in the class on one side and all assignments on the other.</li>
            <li><strong>"One-Click" Grading:</strong> Teachers can see who has submitted, click to view the file, and enter a grade and private feedback—all in one place.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="why-matters">
            <strong>Why This Matters (Benefit to Your School):</strong> This phase completes the assessment loop. It creates a digital "paper trail" for all work, makes grading far more efficient for teachers, and gives students instant, private access
            to their grades and feedback.
